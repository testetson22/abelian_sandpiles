# Abelian sandpiles 
Simulates gravity being applied to a sandpile. Super simple implemention; may have some bugs.

## Usage
`sandpiles x y z` where `x` and `y` are the dimensions of a 2D array and `z` is the height of a center pile of sand. 

## TODO List
- PyTests and linting
- GitHub actions for demo and tests
- Profile and optimize as needed
